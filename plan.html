    <p><strong>Mission Statement</strong><br>
    To redesign the existing Barrier Reef Orchestra website in a way that better promotes the orchestra's services to increase revenue.
    The content will be updated and reorganised to better allow users to find out the information they require.
    The website will be redesigned with a more modern and sophisticated layout to align better with the prestigious nature of the orchestra and the clients wish to cater for a younger demographic.

    
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Success Evaluation</strong><br>
    Current online sales & membership benchmarks will be compared with sales & membership benchmarks that will be taken after the launch of the website.
    The website will be considered a success if the online sales and memberships increase.

    
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br>
    The client has mentioned a desire to get a younger demographic both male and female between the ages of 18 - 40.
    The content will better describe what the orchestra does so that first time goers feel more comfortable.
    The website will be designed with a and sophisticated, cultured layout, to mimic what people like to feel when they attend the orchestra.
    The website will use a blue theme as it is known to produce a calming affect, and is also the colour of the Barrier Reef.
