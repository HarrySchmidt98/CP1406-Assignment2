<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> we worked well and were able to easily work out what was needed of the both of us to complete the set task.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> we were unable to both be online at the same time for the majority of the task. this didnt affect us too much as we were able to pass everything along when we had to go. We were also down a member who did not show for the entire task and we were unable to contact them which put us behind slightly due to the lack of the last member.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> (including significant lessons) we worked well as a team despite missing a member and not being able to talk properly and we were able to finish the task unhindered. we learnt to continue and finish the task despite those setbacks.</p>
